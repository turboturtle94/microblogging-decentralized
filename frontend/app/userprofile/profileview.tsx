              Writing code by day, singing in the shower by night. Occasionally
              seen turning bugs into features and coffee into art. Software dev
              with a side hustle in high notes and brush strokes. I break loops
              and paint moods â€” sometimes in the same hour. Ctrl + Z is my love
              language.
